"Protocol Description"	"1H-NMR spectra of individual mice were acquired at 600.22 MHz on a Bruker Avance-600 spectrometer (Bruker, Coventry, UK) using a 100 μl plasma aliquot. Standard monodimensional spectra were acquired using a selective presaturation pulse sequence for water signal suppression as described elsewhere [16]. For each acquisition, 128 transient-free induction decays (FID) were collected into 32,768 data points using a spectral width of 20 ppm. The FIDs were convoluted with an exponential weighting function corresponding to a line broadening of 0.3 Hz before Fourier transform. The acquired NMR spectra were corrected for phase and baseline distortions using in-house software and referenced to glucose α-anomeric signal (δ5.23) [16]. The 1H-NMR spectra were imported as full-spectrum data [17]. To remove the effects of variation in the suppression of the water resonance, the region (δ4.5–5.0) was discarded. "		"The data were normalised using noise variance normalisation. The final data set was then mean-centred prior to analysis [17]."
