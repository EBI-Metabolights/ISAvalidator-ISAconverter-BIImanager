"Protocol Description"	"All animal procedures conformed to Home Office, UK, guidelines for animal welfare. Male Wistar rats (n ) 3 for each time point; control animals fed control diet for the same time period; Charles River UK Ltd.) were fed either standard laboratory chow, or chow supplemented with 1% orotic acid (Sigma Aldrich, UK) ad libitum.5-6 Rats were killed by cervical dislocation at days 0, 1, 3 and 14, and the left lateral lobe of the liver excised. Tissues were snap frozen and stored at -80 ï¾¡C."	"Total RNA was extracted by RNA Isolation Kit (Stratagene) from the livers of Wistar rats at day 0 (n) 3), day 1 and 3(n) 2), and day 14 (n ) 3)."	"Biotinylated cRNA was prepared following the guidelines described by Affymetrix."	"Biotinylated cRNA probes was hybridized following the guidelines described by Affymetrix."	"GeneChips were scanning following the guidelines described by Affymetrix using Affymetrix Scanner."	"CEL were normalized using Affymetrix MAS 5.0 application."	"Extracts were prepared (n ) 3 for each time point) using an acetonitrile/water extraction procedure as previously described6 and reconstituted in D2O containing 4 mM trisilylpropionic acid (TSP)."	"Solvent suppressed spectra were acquired for tissue extracts on a 5 mm inverse geometry 1H/broadband probe into 32 k data points, averaged over 128 acquisitions."	"Intact tissue ( 10 mg) was examined using a high-resolution magic angle spinning (MAS) probe. Spectra were acquired at a spinning speed of 5000Hz, and solvent suppressed spectra were averaged over 256 acquisitions."
