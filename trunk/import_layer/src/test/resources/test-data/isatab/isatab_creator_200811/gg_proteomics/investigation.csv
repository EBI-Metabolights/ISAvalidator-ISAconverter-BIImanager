"Study Protocol Description"	"Male mice from the 129S6/SvEv and BALB/c inbred strains were used. Mice were weaned at 3 weeks of age and housed in groups of ten. Mice were maintained on a 12-h light and dark cycle and fed ad libitum a standard carbohydrate (CD) chow (ERB, Witham, UK) from weaning. At 5 weeks of age, one group of mice was transferred to an HFD (Special Diets Services, Witham, UK), containing 32% lard oil and 8% corn oil. A separate age-matched group remained on the CD. All procedures were carried out in accordance with national license conditions."	"Total RNA was extracted from frozen liver using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and cleaned with RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). RNA oncentrations and integrity were assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany)."	"cDNA synthesis and biotinlabelled cRNA synthesis was performed using 10 _g of total RNA from each liver sample. cRNA concentrations and integrity were assessed using an Agilent 2100"	"Gene transcription profiling was carried out using Affymetrix expression arrays U430A and B (Affymetrix UK, High Wycombe, UK), which contain 22,690 (U430A) and 22,576 (U430B) probe sets, allowing the interrogation of the transcription level of 13 250 (U430A) and 7577 (U430B) independent gene and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences.Biotinylated cRNAs were fragmented and individually hybridised in an Affymetrix oven to the arrays."	"Washing and staining procedures were performed in an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450. Arrays were scanned at 560 nm using an Agilent array scanner (Affymetrix UK)"	"CEL were normalized using Bioconductor packages implement RMA and quantile normalization"	"1H-NMR spectra of individual mice were acquired at 600.22 MHz on a Bruker Avance-600 spectrometer (Bruker, Coventry, UK) using a 100 _l plasma aliquot. Standard monodimensional spectra were acquired using a selective presaturation pulse sequence for water signal suppression as described elsewhere [16]. For each acquisition, 128 transient-free induction decays (FID) were collected into 32,768 data points using a spectral width of 20 ppm. The FIDs were convoluted with an exponential weighting function corresponding to a line broadening of 0.3 Hz before Fourier transform. The acquired NMR spectra were corrected for phase and baseline distortions using in-house software and referenced to glucose _-anomeric signal (_5.23) [16]. The 1H-NMR spectra were imported as full-spectrum data [17]. To remove the effects of variation in the suppression of the water resonance, the region (_4.5ï¿½5.0) was discarded. "		"The data were normalised using noise variance normalisation. The final data set was then mean-centred prior to analysis [17]."
