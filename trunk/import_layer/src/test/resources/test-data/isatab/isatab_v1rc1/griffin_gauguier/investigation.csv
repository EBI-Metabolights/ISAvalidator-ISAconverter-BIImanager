"Protocol Description"	"All animal procedures conformed to Home Office, UK, guidelines for animal welfare. Male Wistar rats (n ) 3 for each time point;"	"Total RNA was extracted by RNA Isolation Kit (Stratagene) from the livers of Wistar rats at day 0 (n ) 3), day 1 and 3 (n ) 2), and day 14 (n ) 3)."	"Biotinylated cRNA was prepared following the guidelines described by Affymetrix."	"Biotinylated cRNA probes was hybridized following the guidelines described by Affymetrix."	"GeneChips were scanning following the guidelines described by Affymetrix using Affymetrix Scanner."	"CEL were normalized using Affymetrix MAS 5.0 application"	"Extracts were prepared (n ) 3 for each time point) using an acetonitrile/water extraction procedure as previously described6 and reconstituted in D2O containing 4 mM trisilylpropionic acid (TSP)"	"Solvent suppressed spectra were acquired for tissue extracts on a 5 mm inverse geometry 1H/broadband probe into 32 k data points, averaged over 128 acquisitions."	"Intact tissue ( 10 mg) was examined using a high-resolution magic angle spinning (MAS) probe. Spectra were acquired at a spinning speed of 5000 Hz, and solvent suppressed spectra were averaged over 256 acquisitions."					"1H-NMR spectra of individual mice were acquired at 600.22 MHz on a Bruker Avance-600 spectrometer (Bruker, Coventry, UK) using a 100 Î¼l plasma aliquot. Standard monodimensional spectra were acquired using a selective presaturation pulse sequence for water signal suppression as described elsewhere [16]."		"The data were normalised using noise variance normalisation. The final data set was then mean-centred prior to analysis [17]."
