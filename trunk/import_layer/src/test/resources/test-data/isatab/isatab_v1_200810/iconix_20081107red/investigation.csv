"Study Title"	"A gene expression signature that predicts the future onset of drug-induced renal tubular toxicity."					
"Study Submission Date"	07/11/08					
"Study Public Release Date"	07/11/08					
"Study Description"	"One application of genomics in drug safety assessment is the identification of biomarkers to predict compound toxicity before it is detected using traditional approaches, such as histopathology. However, many genomic approaches have failed to demonstrate superiority to traditional methods, have not been appropriately validated on external samples, or have been derived using small data sets, thus raising concerns of their general applicability. Using kidney gene expression profiles from male SD rats treated with 64 nephrotoxic or non-nephrotoxic compound treatments, a gene signature consisting of only 35 genes was derived to predict the future development of renal tubular degeneration weeks before it appears histologically following short-term test compound administration. By comparison, histopathology or clinical chemistry fails to predict the future development of tubular degeneration, thus demonstrating the enhanced sensitivity of gene expression relative to traditional approaches. In addition, the performance of the signature was validated on 21 independent compound treatments structurally distinct from the training set. The signature correctly predicted the ability of test compounds to induce tubular degeneration 76% of the time, far better than traditional approaches. This study demonstrates that genomic data can be more sensitive than traditional methods for the early prediction of compound-induced pathology in the kidney."

"Study Submission Date"

"Study Description"	"A large gene expression database has been produced that characterizes the gene expression and physiological effects of hundreds of approved and withdrawn drugs, toxicants, and biochemical standards in various organs of live rats. In order to derive useful biological knowledge from this large database, a variety of supervised classification algorithms were compared using a 597-microarray subset of the data. Our studies show that several types of linear classifiers based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Logistic Regression can be used to derive readily interpretable drug signatures with high classification performance. Both methods can be tuned to produce classifiers of drug treatments in the form of short, weighted gene lists which upon analysis reveal that some of the signature genes have a positive contribution (act as ""rewards"" for the class-of-interest) while others have a negative contribution (act as ""penalties"") to the classification decision. The combination of reward and penalty genes enhances performance by keeping the number of false positive treatments low. The results of these algorithms are combined with feature selection techniques that further reduce the length of the drug signatures, an important step towards the development of useful diagnostic biomarkers and low-cost assays. Multiple signatures with no genes in common can be generated for the same classification end-point. Comparison of these gene lists identifies biological processes characteristic of a given class."
